# Disease-Detection-of-Apple-Leaf

Algorithm and methods used: This paper uses multiple methods like image
processing - we resize and convert the images from RGB to Grayscale , Feature extraction -
statistical moments of colors (i.e.: mean, min, max, standard deviation, skewness, and
kurtosis of RGB, HSV, and CIELab), Feature selection – it will help us identify the key
features in each disease and further it use PCA algorithm and at the end it classifies and
performs model selection.
